# Sovryn Contracts

## Important Note

This is not the original repository for Sovryn Smart Contracts but my personal playground for contract interactions,
testing and testing and deployment using solely `Python` programming language and `eth-brownie` framework.

You can find the original contracts at [DistributedCollective/Sovryn-smart-contracts](https://github.com/DistributedCollective/Sovryn-smart-contracts)

## Get Started

### Dependencies

* git - tested with v2.25.1
* node.js & npm - tested with node.js v10.19.0 and npm v6.14.4
* curl - tested with v7.68.0
* python3 v3.7.2 or greater
* ganache-cli - tested with v6.9.1
* brownie v1.12.4 or greater

As you can see, the `contracts` and `interfaces` directories are not found in this repository.
You can download them directly from `DistributedCollective`'s repo using the following command.

### Get the latest Sovryn contracts into this playground and

```bash
source update-contracts.sh
```

## Roadmap

* Recreate the testing environment from the main repository and improved upon it using `eth-brownie`
* Integrate Vyper contracts
* Hopefully write some new and useful contracts to add to original repository
